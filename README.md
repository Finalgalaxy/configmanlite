# configman

## Hello!

Do you find, like me, difficult to manage configuration data over time?
Did you try and have struggles on building configuration files and managing them over time, retrieving/saving/removing/adding/editing new parameters into your Java applications while your amazing application grows?
Would you like an easy-to-use, plain-text, alphabetically ordered, version-managed configuration file system?

Here you go! You're in the right place!

ConfigManLite does exactly that. You can just download the JAR and import it through "Build Path"->"Add External Archives" in case you're using Eclipse.

Work in progress for README.
